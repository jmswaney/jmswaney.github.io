Working on the future of audio collaboration at [Samply](https://samplyaudio.com). Alumnus of MIT and UW-Madison.

Drawn towards those computational problems that arise from asking intriguing scientific questions. Imagining how it should be, proposing how it could be done, and working hard to empower those around me and make it so.

Seeking to innovate through cross-pollination, to be inspired through experience, and to shine as bright as possible.
