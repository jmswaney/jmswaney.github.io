Awarded 1st place at the 2019 MIT *Machine Learning Across Disciplines Challenge*,
the Samply sample manager organizes audio samples using machine learning.

The sample manager uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a parametric
approximation to the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE)
algorithm to generate visualizations of audio sample libraries. This work was
later presented at the 2020 Audio Engineering Society conference.
