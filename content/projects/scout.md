Published in *Scientific Reports*, the SCOUT pipeline enables
rapid staining, imaging, and analysis of 3D cerebral organoids. We
applied SCOUT to compare different culture protocols as well as to
study how Zika virus inhibits organoid growth.

SCOUT's computational pipeline is a Python package with a pre-built
Docker image. The package also includes a pre-trained U-Net model
for segmentation of ventricular zones in cerebral organoids based
solely on nuclear staining.
